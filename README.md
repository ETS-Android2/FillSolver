## How To Use The App
**Set A Starting Point**

   - If no starting point is set, the program defaults to (0,0) as the starting point
  
**Remove Spaces From Grid**
1. Click on the cells in the grid to remove them
   - Clicking on a cell again will unremove it
   
**Start the Solver**

**Resetting**
1. To reset, press the reset button
   - Starting Point will be removed

## Output
Once the user presses the start button, the program will assign each cell in the grid a number representing the order in which the cells should be filled up. 

It will also highlight the solution path one cell at a time (every 100ms). If you blink and miss that animation, you can press the replay button (right above the "Start" button) to restart the animation.
